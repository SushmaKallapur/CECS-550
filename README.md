Pattern Recognition 

Programming Assignment:
a- Assume that the prior probabilities for the first two categories are equal (洧녞(洧랪1)=洧녞(洧랪2)=1/2  洧녞(洧랪3)=0) and design dichotomizer for those two categories using only the 洧논洧논1 feature value.
b- Determine the empirical training error on your samples, that is the percentage of points misclassified.
c- Repeat all above, but now use two feature values, 洧논1,洧논2
d- Repeat all above but use all three feature values
e- Discuss your results. In particular, is it ever possible for a finite set of data that the empirical error might be larger for more data dimensions?
